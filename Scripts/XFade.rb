#  Place this script in the "Materials" section of the scripts above main.     #
#  This script is pretty much plug and play with a few options available to    #
#  change below.  To start the "cross-fade audio", simply enable the switch    #
#  you defined in the settings.  Note that this script uses the bgs            #
#  (background sound) to allow the cross fade to work, so you cannot play a    #
#  bgs while the switch is turned on.  Also note that playing a ME (music      #
#  effect) of any type will disable the cross-fade, so it will need to be      #
#  re-enabled afterwards.  It is recommended that you start playing a music    #
#  before enabling cross-fade since it will cause the newly played bgm to      #
#  cross fade either from the old bgm or from nothing.  Also note that this    #
#  script only works with .OGG and .WAV files.                                 #
#      Short Instructions:                                                     #
#  1. Turn switch on to enable.                                                #
#  2. Turn the switch off to diable.                                           #
#  3. Playing a ME disables cross-fade.                                        #
#  4. Only use .OGG and .WAV files.                                            #
#                                                                              #
#      Special Note:                                                           #
#  Okay, at the expense of sounding like I don't know what I'm doing (which I  #
#  can't say I entirely do) there are some issues with the script which I am   #
#  unable to resolve (and most likely will never be able to unless someone     #
#  decides to rip apart the "audio" module so I can find out how it actually   #
#  works).  The first issue involves stereo tracks and the position offset     #
#  (see below).  For some reason, a stereo track that has been offset and      #
#  played as a "bgs" will have a split second of static at the end and I'm     #
#  not entirely sure why.  The simple solution is to just now have any stereo  #
#  tracks (just use mono).  Of course if you have this issue with mono tracks  #
#  PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!  I will do what I can to solve the issue then.  The    #
#  second issue is also with the position tracking and has nothing to do with  #
#  anything I did at all but is actually a "bug" that vxa already has but      #
#  which would have been otherwise impossible to detect.  When trying to       #
#  determine the "position" of the current song, the value is actually only    #
#  updated every 8~12 frames.  This means no matter how much I try to modify   #
#  what I can see, there will always be a slight variance of roughly 150       #
#  milliseconds.  This is barely noticable and in my opinion no big deal.  I   #
#  no plans to try to fix this (once again, unless someone rips apart the      #
#  audio module).  If there are any other issues noted with the script         #
#  besides these two, please contact me with details (and a demo with the      #
#  issue or a video or something else).                                        #

# This is the switch used by the script to determine if cross fading is being  #
# used or not.                                                                 #
SWITCH = 11 # Default = 11                                                     #
#                                                                              #
# This determines what to do if the program tries to play a bms while cross-   #
# fade is enabled.  If this is set to TRUE it will treat it the same as        #
# bgm_play.  If this is set to FALSE it does nothing.                          #
DO_BGM = false # Default = false                                               #

# Okay, this one is kind of odd.  When a new bgm is called and the script      #
# tries to play it from the old position, it doesn't play from exactly the     #
# same position.  This value actually tells the script to play the new song    #
# from a position a little later in the song to account for discrepancy,       #
# however, even then it is not exact (see above).  If you are using music      #
# with a different bitrate than the demo, this may need to be adjusted.  This  #
# value is (I believe) in bytes, not any actual length of time.                #
OFFSET = 26650 # Default = 26650                                               #
#                                                                              #
#                                                                              #
